    <h3> Projects </h3>
     <br></br>

    <li> Degree's final project </li>
    <p>The project was based on creating a virtual box network which contained 3 machines that acted as clients, one on Ubuntu 18.04 and one on Windows 10 There were also 3 machines that acted as servers, an SMTP server that also managed users through LDAP and DHCP, there was also a MySQL server which emulated as if an employee had to connect from a client machine I also had an FTP server which I served as file transfer for the entire network It also had two firewalls configured with apache and the rules Spyder owasp, and apache, they were also configured through the use of iptables And also two honeypots, one based on Ubuntu 18.04 and the other on Kali Linux</p>
    <br></br>

   
   
    <li> Project Software engineering </li>
    <p> A project that the idea was to manage some objects (in this case they were fictitious hydroalcoholic gel cans) programmed in c ++ and manage them as if they were in the entire faculty It was all in c ++ to practice object-oriented programming in c ++ with eclipse </p>
    <br></br>

 
   
    <li> Project 2 with Microsoft Azure Chatbot with LUIS </li>
    <p>LUIS is a cloud-based conversational artificial intelligence service that applies personalized machine learning intelligence to a user's natural language text or conversation to predict global meaning and extract relevant and detailed information. The idea and objective of the project is through the design of a chatbot in python and the use of the tools provided by Azure, so that the user can converse and obtain a response from the system itself.  </p>
    <br></br>


 
   <li> Project 1 with Microsoft Azure, Project Faces </li>
   <p> The first project with Microsoft Azure is based on using the face detection tool using python functions: Creation of a group element, Assignment of faces to person objects, Training of the PersonGroup element (Once the faces are assigned, you must train the group object so that it identifies the visual characteristics associated with each of its person objects), Output of identified face IDs, We create a list to store several photos, it detects the face of several images and returns us some parameters, It verifies if the faces are of the same person or if the faces are from a different person, we also create a rectangle that is placed where a face has been detected. </p>
   <br></br>



   <li> Data analysis work in Power B </li>
   <p> The project consisted of analyzing the data provided in a .csv and creating different graphs to analyze the data as if we were a company that has to bring a new product to the market, and, to analyze the competition, we have data from a market study in a .csv, and through the study of graphs, see if it would be viable or not, and what characteristics we can improve </p>
   <br></br>



   <li> Blockchain creation project with Python </li>
   <p> It is about the creation of a Blockchain in Python which we are going to develop an application that allows users to share information through a blockchain. We developed a small interface for use using the Flask microframework.
        The steps would be: Storing the transactions in blocks, Adding the fingerprints, Chaining the blocks, Implementing a proof-of-work algorithm, Adding blocks to the chain, Creating the interfaces, Establishing consensus and decentralization
        We would like to prevent any kind of tampering with the information stored within a block. To detect if the information in a block has been tampered with, we can use cryptographic hash functions.
        We are going to use the same Hash encryption that Bitcoin uses, SHA-256, to create the signature of the blocks
        And with Flask we create the interface in HTML </p>
   <br></br>



   <li> Cluster monitoring </li>
   <p> The idea of the project is to create a network in virtualbox in which there is the master node and two slave nodes in which through the monitoring of Ganglia, whose utility is to monitor what is happening in the cluster
       The network configuration is first to ping between the machines, then use hdfs, hadoop, hive, flume and the ganglia itself that have previously been installed and configured
       And when everything is ready, analyze the consumption of RAM, network, CPU... Of the nodes while we execute different programs that we have previously created </p>

    <h3> Hobbies </h3>
    <p>I have participated in #100DaysOfCode, I have developed projects for network administration purposes. Designing my personal brand, as well as interested in photography.</p>
    <br></br>

    <li> Carrying out my personal brand </li>
    <p> With the help of my creativity, ambition and desire to grow, in my free time I develop a personal brand through my own designs. </p>
